# Examples Chap02

The examples for chapter 2

## Introduction

We will start in the Chapter 2 of the book: Regression methods in biostatistics: linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures models, Vittinghoff et al. The first example to load a dataset is using the The western collaborative group study (WCGS).  We will use tidyverse tools to load (read_csv) and visualize (ggplot).

```{r loading, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
setwd("~/Dropbox/Fdo/ClaseStats/RegresionClass/RegresionR_code")
# To set the working directory at the user dir 
wcgs <- read_csv("DataRegressBook/Chap2/wcgs.csv")
# Loading the WCGS database in wcgs varible
glimpse(wcgs)
summary(wcgs)
```
  The first line of code loads the library for `tidyverse`, then sets the working directory to point at my user and the directory that I have copyed the data from Vittinghoff's book. Then shows 22 variables in lines (not all the observations) and the summary of the numerical variables, `summary` automatically estimates general statistics for the numerical variables of the dataset. 

## Including Plots

Lets see from the WCGS data a summery of the systolic blod pressure (sbp), followed by a histogram, were the theoretical best possible number of bins was estimated with the formula bins = 1 + 3.3log(3144) that results in about 13, so after using 15 bins, the binwith results in 9.
Then there is a boxplot of the dbp variable and a scatter plot of the same varible, and finally ggplot is used to manipulate the point characteristics and finally we have the same ploit at figure 2.9 in the book.

```{r sytolic, echo=FALSE}
summary(wcgs$sbp)
## to estimate the number of bins (max - min)/#bins
# #bins 1+3.3log(3144) ~ 13 so using #bins 15
# binswith 8.8 -> 9
ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sbp), binwidth = 9.0)
# to generate fig 2.3 or the systolic blood pressure with ggplot
ggplot(data = wcgs, aes(y = sbp)) + geom_boxplot()
# other boxplot comments
# ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sbp, fill = weight))
# ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sbp, fill = weight), position = "dodge")
ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_qq(aes(sample = sbp))
# ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_qq(aes(sample = 1:310), dist = qt, dparam = list(df=5)) sample, sbp ..theoretical..
# scatter plot of the sbp data over weight 
ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = sbp))
# to add a smoothed representative plot figure 2.9 
ggplot(data = wcgs) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = sbp)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = sbp))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
