# Regresion class 2019
  This is the repository for the examples and Rmarkdown, homework and other files for regression class 2019, almost all the examples that I will deposit here are Rmarkdown vertions of the examples at Rcode.
As mention in the class the general course is based (‘loosely based’) on the material of the text book: Vittinghoff, Glidden, Shiboski, and McCulloch, “Regression methods in biostatistics: linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures models”, ISBN 0-387-20275-7, Springer 2005. https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461413523.  From a net connection inside the UNAM, you can download the book’s pdf for free.
For the coursework is mandatory that you use R and highly recommended that you use RStudio. The Rmarkdown examples are formatted for you to copy the R code to the console and run the examples, you can play with the code and experiment with different parameters and ideas, and then to generate your own R code.
I will try to keep the repository formatted, nevertheless I cannot be sure if I will.
